# Parsing parenthesized numbers

OK, now we're all set to start making a LALRPOP grammar. Before we
tackle full expressions, let's start with something simple -- really
simple. Let's just start with parenthesized integers, like `123` or
`(123)` or even (hold on to your hats) `(((123)))`. Wow.

To handle this, we'll need to add a
[`calculator1.lalrpop`][calculator1] as shown below. Note: to make
explaining things easier, this version is maximally explicit; the next
section will make it shorter by employing some shorthands that LALRPOP
offers.

```lalrpop
use std::str::FromStr;

grammar;

pub Term: i32 = {
    <n:Num> => n,
    "(" <t:Term> ")" => t,
};

Num: i32 = <s:r"[0-9]+"> => i32::from_str(s).unwrap();
```

Let's look at this bit by bit. The first part of the file is the `use`
statement and the `grammar` declaration. You'll find these at the top
of every LALRPOP grammar. Just as in Rust, the `use` statement just
brings names in scope: in fact, these `use` statements are just copied
verbatim into the generated Rust code as needed.

*A note about underscores and hygiene:* LALRPOP generates its own
names that begin with at least two leading underscores. To avoid
conflicts, it will insert more underscores if it sees that you use
identifiers that also have two underscores. But if you use glob
imports that bring in names beginning with `__`, you may find you have
invisible conflicts. To avoid this, don't use a glob (or define some
other name with two underscores somewhere else).

**Nonterminal declarations.** After the `grammar` declaration comes a
series of *nonterminal declarations*.  This grammar has two
nonterminals, `Term` and `Num`. A nonterminal is just a name that we
give to something which can be parsed. Each nonterminal is then
defined in terms of other things.

Let's start with `Num`, at the end of the file, which is declared
as follows:

```lalrpop
Num: i32 =
    <s:r"[0-9]+"> => i32::from_str(s).unwrap();
```

This declaration says that the type of `Num` is `i32`. This means that
when we parse a `Num` from the input text, we will produce a value of
type `i32`. The definition of `Num` is `<s:r"[0-9]+">`.  Let's look at
this from the inside out. The notation `r"[0-9]+"` is a regex literal
-- this is the same as a Rust raw string. (And, just as in Rust, you
can use hashes if you need to embed quotes, like `r#"..."..."#`.)  It
will match against a string of characters that matches the regular
expression: in this case, some number of digits. The result of this
match will be a slice `&'input str` into the input text that we are
parsing (no copies are made).

This regular expression is wrapped in angle brackets and labeled:
`<s:r"[0-9]+">`. In general, angle brackets are used in LALRPOP to
indicate the values that will be used by the *action code* -- that is,
the code that executes when a `Num` is parsed.  In this case, the
string that matches the regular expression is bound to the name `s`,
and the action code `i32::from_str(s).unwrap()` parses that string and
creates an `i32`. Hence the result of parsing a `Num` is an `i32`.

OK, now let's look at the nonterminal `Term`:

```lalrpop
pub Term: i32 = {
    <n:Num> => n,
    "(" <t:Term> ")" => t,
};
```

First, this nonterminal is declared as `pub`. That means that LALRPOP
will generate a public struct (named, as we will see, `TermParser`)
that you can use to parse strings as `Term`. Private nonterminals
(like `Num`) can only be used within the grammar itself, not from
outside.

The `Term` nonterminal has two alternative definitions, which is
indicated by writing `{ alternative1, alternative2 }`. In this case,
the first alternative is `<n:Num>`, meaning that a term can be just a
number; so `22` is a term. The second alternative is `"(" <t:Term>
")"`, which indicates that a term can also be a parenthesized term; so
`(22)` is a term, as is `((22))`, `((((((22))))))`, and so on.

**Invoking the parser.** OK, so we wrote our parser, how do we use it?
For every nonterminal `Foo` declared as `pub`, LALRPOP will export a
`FooParser` struct with a `parse` method that you can call to parse a
string as that nonterminal. Here is a simple test that we've added to 
our [`main.rs`][main] file which uses this struct to test our `Term`
nonterminal:

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate lalrpop_util;

lalrpop_mod!(pub calculator1); // synthesized by LALRPOP

#[test]
fn calculator1() {
    assert!(calculator1::TermParser::new().parse("22").is_ok());
    assert!(calculator1::TermParser::new().parse("(22)").is_ok());
    assert!(calculator1::TermParser::new().parse("((((22))))").is_ok());
    assert!(calculator1::TermParser::new().parse("((22)").is_err());
}
```

The full signature of the parse method looks like this:

```rust
fn parse<'input>(&self, input: &'input str)
                     -> Result<i32, ParseError<usize,(usize, &'input str),()>>
                     //        ~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     //         |                       |
                     // Result upon success             |
                     //                                 |
                     //             Error enum defined in the lalrpop_util crate
{
    ...
}
```
