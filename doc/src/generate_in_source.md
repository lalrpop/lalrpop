Up to version 0.15, LALRPOP was generating its files in the same directory
of the input files. Since 0.16, files are generated in the Cargo's
**output directory**.

If you want to keep the previous behaviour, you can use `generate_in_source_tree`
in your configuration:

```rust
fn main() {
    lalrpop::Configuration::new()
        .generate_in_source_tree()
        .process().unwrap();
}
```

For each `foo.lalrpop` file you can simply have `mod foo;` in your source tree.
The `lalrpop_mod` macro is not useful in this mode.
